# Program Output:
1) While training, program will output the cost (how wrong the nueral network is) for each input.
2) When finished training, program will output 1 percentage per category which is the percentage of the time that it got a drawing in that category correct.

# Program Window
In the program window, you can use the mouse to draw shapes in the white box. 
Press R to reset the drawing.
Press D to draw a random drawing from the data set to the screen.
